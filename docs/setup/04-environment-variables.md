# Setup 04 — Environment Variables Reference

> **Status:** Current · **Updated:** 2026-07-12

> The single reference for every env var. Mirrors [`.env.example`](../../.env.example).
> **Secrets never go in the repo** — only in `.env.local` (git-ignored), Vercel
> project settings, and GitHub Action secrets.

## The variables

| Variable | Public? | Where used | Value / source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | **Public** (shipped to browser) | client + server | Supabase → **Connect** button (or Settings → Data API) → **Project URL** (`https://<ref>.supabase.co`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | **Public** | client + server | Supabase → Settings → **API Keys** → **Publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`). Safe in the browser **because RLS constrains it** — never rely on it being secret. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | **Public** | auth redirects, absolute URLs | `http://localhost:3000` locally; your prod URL in prod. |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | **SECRET — server only** | server only (avoid unless required) | Supabase → Settings → **API Keys** → **Secret** key (`sb_secret_…`). **Bypasses RLS** — keep out of the browser bundle and out of git. MVP tries to avoid needing it. |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` | local/CI only | Supabase CLI, keep-warm | Supabase → Settings → General → **Reference ID**. |
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | **SECRET — local/CI** | Supabase CLI auth | Created by `supabase login` / Supabase account tokens. Used for CLI & type-gen in CI. |
| `OWNER_USER_ID` | server only (Vercel) | gates `/admin` + the Settings owner link | Supabase → Authentication → Users → your row's **UID**. Never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | GitHub Action secrets | arms `keep-warm.yml` | Same values as the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars above — exact names, no prefix. |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL` | **SECRET — GitHub Actions only** | arms `backup.yml` (weekly DB dump) | Dashboard **Connect** button → **Session pooler** URI with the DB password filled in. ⚠ Not the direct connection (IPv6-only on free tier — unreachable from GitHub runners) and not the transaction pooler (breaks pg_dump). |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **SECRET — GitHub Actions only** | arms `backup.yml` (AES-256-encrypts the weekly DB dump before upload) | Any strong passphrase you generate — store it in your password manager. `backup.yml` **fails loud and uploads nothing** if this is missing (the public-repo artifact contains `auth.users`). You need the same passphrase to decrypt/restore. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **SECRET — GitHub Actions only** | arms `reconcile-storage.yml` (orphan sweep), `photo-backup.yml` (monthly B2 photo mirror) **and** `b2-purge.yml` (delete-path B2 purge) | Settings → API Keys → a **Secret key** (`sb_secret_…`; a legacy `service_role` JWT also works). Bypasses RLS — never in the app runtime or Vercel. *(Name kept for the historical role it maps to; the app-side equivalent concept is `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`.)* |
| `B2_KEY_ID` / `B2_APP_KEY` / `B2_BUCKET` | **SECRET — GitHub Actions only** | arm `photo-backup.yml` (monthly off-site B2 photo mirror) **and** `b2-purge.yml` (delete-path purge of a deleted account's photos) | Backblaze B2 → an application key scoped to the bucket with **Read & Write** (the write role already grants `deleteFiles`, which b2-purge requires — the script fails loud otherwise). `B2_BUCKET` is the bucket name. Reused as-is by both workflows; no separate delete key. |

> Naming rule: **`NEXT_PUBLIC_` is a promise that the value is public** (Next.js
> inlines it into the client bundle). Never prefix a secret with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Where each lives

| Location | Which vars | How |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.local` (your machine, git-ignored) | the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` + any you need locally | `cp .env.example .env.local` then fill in. |
| **Vercel** → Project → Settings → Environment Variables | `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` + `OWNER_USER_ID` (+ `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` only if ever used) | set per environment (Prod/Preview). |
| **GitHub** → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (keep-warm) · `SUPABASE_DB_URL` + `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (backup) · `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `B2_KEY_ID`/`B2_APP_KEY`/`B2_BUCKET` (orphan sweep, photo mirror, B2 purge) · `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` if CI ever needs the CLI | which are actually set: [production-state](../operations/production-state.md). |

## Common errors & fixes
- Putting a secret behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_` → it leaks to every visitor. Don't.
- Forgetting to set vars for the **Preview** environment in Vercel → preview
  deploys can't reach Supabase.
- Editing `.env.local` and not restarting `pnpm dev` → changes not picked up.
- Committing `.env.local` → if it happens, **rotate the keys** immediately.

## How to verify success
- `pnpm dev` connects to Supabase (you can sign in and read/write).
- A Vercel preview build succeeds and reaches Supabase.
- No secret value appears in the browser dev-tools "Sources"/network (only the
  publishable key + public URL should be visible client-side).
